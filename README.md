# GCRF-Final
This is the workflow and everything I'm doing to process the Grey-Crowned Rosy Finch (Leucosticte tephrocotis dawsoni) sequence data for the first chapter of my thesis.

A cleaner version of the previously used GCRF-Present

Notes for Eric:
  I've uploaded the bones of my Snakemake workflow, omitting the data, reference genome, and outputs because they are too large to work here. I'm still struggling to get it to work. I think all the code in the Snakemake file is correct and working, the issue is now with getting it to function nicely through slurm...
  Other things in this repo include all my notes for my GWAS progress including some results from that. I've also recently started doing a populat-by-population comparison but I'm not sure what will come of that.
